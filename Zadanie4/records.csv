July,1991,"Biham and Shamir rediscover differential cryptanalysis, and apply it to a 15-round DES-like cryptosystem."
,1992,"Biham and Shamir report the first theoretical attack with less complexity than brute force: differential cryptanalysis. However, it requires an unrealistic 247 chosen plaintexts."

January,1999,"Together, Deep Crack and distributed.net break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes."
25 October,1999,"DES is reaffirmed for the fourth time as FIPS 46-3, which specifies the preferred use of Triple DES, with single DES permitted only in legacy systems."

26 July,2004,The withdrawal of FIPS 46-3 (and a couple of related standards) is proposed in the Federal Register[23]
19 May,2005,"NIST withdraws FIPS 46-3 (see Federal Register vol 70, number 96)"
April,2006,"The FPGA-based parallel machine COPACOBANA of the Universities of Bochum and Kiel, Germany, breaks DES in 9 days at a $10,000 hardware cost.[24] Within a year software improvements reduced the average time to 6.4 days."

August,2016,The Open Source password cracking software hashcat added in DES brute force searching on general purpose GPUs. Benchmarking shows a single off the shelf Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU costing US$1000 recovers a key in an average of 15 days (full exhaustive search taking 30 days). Systems have been built with eight GTX 1080 Ti GPUs which can recover a key in an average of under 2 days.[25]
July,2017,A chosen-plaintext attack utilizing a rainbow table can recover the DES key for a single specific chosen plaintext 1122334455667788 in 25 seconds. A new rainbow table has to be calculated per plaintext. A limited set of rainbow tables have been made available for download.[26]
